1. find /etc -type f > one.txt 2> two.txt

	a. this command searches files in the /etc directory and the directories within
	   the /etc directory. It finds and saves all files hence -type f and saves 
	   the stdout which is the file paths to one.txt and the stderror to two.txt hence the 2>

	b. cat one.txt lists all of the files in the /etc directory 

	   cat two.txt shows errors resulting from the use of the 'find' command.
	   these errors were caused by my user account lacking permissions to view the files and directories 
	   (specifically the ones that said "permission denied").

2.   
	As per the Dataset, Top 3 [Month, Year] with the most number of YouTube channels created were :
	1. March,2006 with 15 channels
	2. July,2014 with 13 channels 
	3. August,2014 with 12 channels
	
	The command used to find this was:
		cut -d ',' -f 20,21 'Global YouTube Statistics.csv' | tail -n +2 | sort -t ',' -k 2,2 -k 1,1 | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -3
		*The cut -d ',' 20,21 'Global YouTube Statistics.csv' command pulls the 20th and 21st fields from the dataset file and the -d ',' specifies the columns being comma separated
		*tail -n +2 skips the first line in the file that's the format header
		*sort -t ',' -k 2,2 -k 1,1 sorts the data in the order year, month
		*uniq -c counts frequency of each m/y combination
		*sort -nr sorts in reverse order (this puts the m/y that appears the most frequently first)
		*head -3 only gives the top 3 m/y combinations

3. The command that I would use to find all the processes owned by me [shervanf23] -> ps -u shervanf23

	OUTPUT:
 
	PID TTY          TIME CMD
	3681568 ?        00:00:01 systemd
	3681570 ?        00:00:00 (sd-pam)
	3681576 ?        00:00:00 sshd
	3681582 pts/96   00:00:00 bash
	3717442 pts/96   00:00:00 ps
		
4.	a) used vi file.txt

	b)     PID TTY          TIME CMD
	   3967976 ?        00:00:00 systemd
	   3967977 ?        00:00:00 (sd-pam)
	   3967985 ?        00:00:00 sshd
	   3967988 pts/114  00:00:00 bash
	   3970054 ?        00:00:00 sshd
	   3970059 pts/113  00:00:00 bash
	   3970320 pts/114  00:00:00 vim
	   3970593 pts/113  00:00:00 ps

	There were a few other processes that showed up compared to the first usage of the command with just one terminal instance open.
	Each listed process also shows which terminal it's being used in (pts = pseudo-terminal, the number after is the number of the pts).
	The PID for the vim process is as seen above, 3970320

	c) used :q! to exit vi in terminal 1

	d)    PID TTY          TIME CMD
	   3967976 ?        00:00:00 systemd
	   3967977 ?        00:00:00 (sd-pam)
	   3967985 ?        00:00:00 sshd
	   3967988 pts/114  00:00:00 bash
	   3970054 ?        00:00:00 sshd
	   3970059 pts/113  00:00:00 bash
	   3972794 pts/113  00:00:00 ps

	The vim process no longer shows up in the list because it was closed in the first terminal. After closing the vim, the ps
	command is running but as you can see the PID 3972794 differs from the first run of the command, which indicates that the first ps
	instance has ended and the command has been run again. 

5.	The init process in Linux is th;e initialization process. It's the first process started by the kernel and has PID of 1. 
	The command that I used to find the pid was for the "systemd" (init) process was -> ps aux | grep "systemd"

6.	ps aux 
	
	ps displays information about active processes. It creates a list of the processes with information such as user of the process owner, the PID (process id), TTY, the cpu time of the process, etc.
	More specifically, the 'a' refers to all processes on the system, 'u' refers to the information of those processes, and x makes sure that all foreground and background processes are included.
